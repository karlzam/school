Describe the two data sets in one notebook (inputs and targets) and explain how they can be used for regression and classification.

    "# Introduction \n",
    "Regression and classification are both predictive problems where past information is used to predict future observations. The goal of regression is to predict numerical values, and the goal of classification is predict categorical values. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, I present two different datasets - one for classification and one for regression. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Regression\n",
    "As stated in Bishop, C. M. (2006), the goal of regression is to predict the value of one or more continuous target variables t given the value of a D-dimensional vector x of input variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Below I provide a summary of linear regression as explained in Bishop, C. M. (2006):\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear models form the basis for more sophisticated regression models. Linear models involve a linear combination of input variables\n",
    "\n",
    "$y(x,w) = w_{0} + w_{1}x_{1} + ... + w_{D}x_{D}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where \n",
    "\n",
    "$x = (x_{1},....,x_{D})^{T}$. This is known as linear regression. \n",
    "\n",
    "A significant limitation of linear regression is that it only allows for a linear function of the input variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, the dataset I chose is based on a paper by Insley, S. (2017), which discusses seasonal patterns in ambient noise near Sachs Harbour, Northwest Territories. \n",
    "\n",
    "### K-Nearest Neighbours\n",
    "The KNN regression algorithm has the ability to work well with non-linear relationships, because it uses nearest neighbours to predict future observations. It assumes that similar things exist in close proximity. In KNN, the distance between an existing data point and a query data point are calculated, and the distances are then sorted from smallest to largest. The first K entries are selected, and if a regression problem, the mean of the K labels is returned. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Classification\n",
    "Classification is using one or more variables to predict a categorical variable of interest. I will discuss the basics of classification in the classification section below, using a dataset on mushrooms.\n"
